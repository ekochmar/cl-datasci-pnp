    "The California House Prices Dataset was originally obtained from the StatLib repository. This dataset contains collected information on variables (e.g., median income, number of households, precise geographical position) using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Census. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data, and on average it includes $1425.5$ individuals living in a geographically compact area. The [original data](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html) contains $20640$ observations on $9$ variables, with the *median house value* being the dependent variable (or *target attribute*). The [modified dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices) from Aurelien Geron, *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow* contains an additional categorical variable.\n",

If your data is representative of the task at hand, this should help ensure that the results of the model testing are informative.

For that, you need to subtract the min from the actual value and divide by the difference between the maximum and minimum values, i.e.:\n",

    "- [`RandomizedSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html), as opposed to the `GridSearchCV` used in the practical, does not try out each parameter values combination. Instead it only tries a fixed number of parameter settings sampled from the specified distributions. As a result, it allows you to try out a wider range of parameter values in a less expensive way than `GridSearchCV`. Apply `RandomizedSearchCV` and compare the best estimator results.\n",

    "Use the bike sharing dataset (`./bike_sharing/bike_hour.csv`, check `./bike_sharing/Readme.txt` for the description), apply the ML steps and gain insights from the data. What data transformations should be applied? Which attributes are most predictive? What additional attributes can be introduced? Which regression model performs best?"

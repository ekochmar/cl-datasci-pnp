The closer the actual ROC curve gets to this point, the better is the classifier. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line from the left bottom to the top right corners. Points above the diagonal represent good classification results (better than random); points below the line represent bad results (worse than random).\n",

    "The original representation of the data that you've been using so far is simply not expressive enough. But what if you could transform this data in such a way that it could be linearly separated? In fact, there is a \"trick\" around this problem that involves transforming the original data using a number of new dimensions in such a way that in this new high-dimensional space the classes become linearly separable. This \"trick\" is commonly known as *kernel trick* or *kernel method*.\n",

However, some other linear classifiers, including [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_perceptron), allow for the kernel methods to be used as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general motivation behind the kernel trick is as follows: when the data is not linearly separable, i.e. there is no clear dividing boundary between the two classes, the kernel trick allows you to transform the data using a number of additional dimensions that would allow for such clear dividing boundary to be learned. Kernel methods require a user-specified kernel, i.e. a function that will transform the original data into a higher dimensional space. Polynomial and Gaussian (also known as *radial-basis function*) transformations are among the most widely used kernel functions. These data transformations might remind you of the polynomial feature transformation used with linear regression in practical 1: recall that you cast the original features from the space where the relation between the features and the output cannot exactly be captured by a linear function, into a higher dimensional feature space using  polynomial function. Recall also that this allowed you to apply a linear function to this new feature space with an improved result.\n",

On the other hand, the training sets with the *OvO* will be much smaller and more balanced. Some classifiers scale poorly with the size of the training set, so *OvO* for them is preferable (e.g., such are SVMs), but most of the linear classifiers use *OvA* instead.\n",
